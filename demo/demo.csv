0176496920,"Arrived on time in mint condition great!  I would buy something from this seller again in the future! Have a great day!"
0176496920,"This device was hard to find for my daughter's OT school class from the description provided by the teacher. Fortunately, the key words were adequate to find the correct device, and it works as needed."
0176496920,Was hoping it came in the box but just bubble wrap and a slip of paper. No complaints though as it works perfectly and is full battery.
0176496920,Great response card. Slow shipping but it works! A lot cheaper than going to the bookstore to gauge your eyes out with the price. It's a shame. really. Making us poor college students who have no financial aid and no job. Just buy the used stuff!
0176496920,It only lasted for 3 days before it stopped working
0176496920,"There is no license with the purchase. I purchased thinking there would be a license with it, but there wasn't. Then the device never worked  I got a zero for my clicker questions because the clicker never recorded my answers into the system. If you are thinking about purchasing this item don't get it somewhere else."
0840026080,Works great in class. Arrived quickly.  I was lucky that the WiFi at school wasn't working right the day I needed it. So now I'm all set up for classes.
0840026080,Does a satisfactory job. Compatible with Kent State University systems.
0840026080,"Needed this for school. The bookstore was selling them for $70. This was much cheaper. Works just fine. Minus 1 star because it came with a partially drained battery, but it was used, so that is expected."
0840026080,"The product has been working great, and really appreciate the fast shipping. Only thing was that the product came in without working batteries. So hence as a customer I wasn't  completely satisfied, but all in all great product."
0840026080,"I got it for 4.99$ plus 5$ shipping(not sure if it was intentional). Works as intended.
there is no point in buying a new one when you can buy used one."
0840026080,"I ordered a turningpoint response card and got it on time. The sender sent me an e-mail explaining why he had to ship it late, everything was convenient. Good job!"
